# Data Hub Template

This repository is a template for creating data science projects. It provides a basic structure for organizing your project files and directories. The template includes directories for storing raw and processed data, Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and machine learning, and Python scripts for data collection and processing.

## Directory Structure
